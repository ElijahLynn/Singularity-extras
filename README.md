## Features

### Grid Generators

Grid generators are functions used to create grids. You should use these when adding a grid using Singularity in place of where you were normally simply write out a grid.

* **Compound Grids**
	* Compound Grids combine multiple symmetric grids together to create a new asymmetric grid
	* Can compound up to 16 grids together
	* `compound($grid1, $grid2, $grid3â€¦)`
* **Ratio Based Grid**
	* Grid that gets larger or smaller based on a ratio
	* Required parameters: `$ratio`, `$steps` (how many columns you'd like), `$start` (either `'small'` or `'large'`, defaults to `'small'`)
	* `ratio(golden(), 5)`
* **Ratio Spiral Grid**
	* Grid based on a spiral of the given ratio
	* Required parameters: `$depth` (number of turns, defaults to `5`), `$ratio` (defaults to `golden()`), `$invert` (inverts grid, defaults to `false`)
	* `ratio-spiral()`
